P4 - Name Analyzer

2 Late Days used

As you may infer, I was hard pressed on time and didn't have too much time
to focus on this program. It is mostly functional and has majority of the
name analysis done with the exception of some unique cases related to the
struct type. Many of the struct errors are instead caught as "undeclared
identifier" or "multiply declared identifier". However, the errors are
caught as needed. Moreover the name analysis structure should be mostly
in place as needed such that the majority of the program is completed.

The SemSym, P4, and ErrMsg classes have been modified as needed.

For testing, I did some very basic test, such that every node was used at
least once. Furthermore as you can see, I print out the type more lazily
than shown in the spec, such that every use of the identifier has the type
included in the print out statement. I decided that this functionality has
no impact on the final result, and if anything makes it easier to interpret
as well as implement - in the world of engineering I'd say a win-win.
