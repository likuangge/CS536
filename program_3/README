P3 - Parser

ONE LATE DAY USED

This is the implementation of the parser for the YES language. This follows
the conventions of the language as defined by the CFlat.grammar to read in
a source file and parse it correctly with spacing, associativity, and
parantheses around each ExpNode.

Nothing fancy was done otherwise. One by one, the rules were implemented
and cascaded to implement simple rules. This controlled the development
complexity and minimized bugs.

To run testing simply 'make' the directory and the run:
'java P3 test.cf output.cf'

The output, should generate a pretty printed source.
