There are several assumptions I made when parsing for tokens, one in particular
is what makes a valid identifier. I allowed any variable with a leading _ or 
letter - disallowing numbers, such that '_1abc' is invalid for an identifier.

Other assumptions were quite straightforward and hopefully there won't be any
issues stemmed from them.

The first test checks only for valid tokens listed exactly as on the program
spec page. The second test generates a file of roughly 100,000 possible tokens
- which 60% turn out to be valid (non whitespace). This randomly generates a file
including the line number and character count. In the remainder of the tests
I check the return values from the CFlat.jlex which are returned as per the spec.
Finally a diff is ran between the 'gold standard' and what the CFlat.jlex 
generated according to my rules.

In order to accomodate this kind of testing I found it helpful to seperate the
tokens by spaces - purely for the diff results. Otherwise my random generator was
able to write consecutive '-' or '+'s which would be picked up at '--' or '++' 
respectively. As per the Piazza question I asked this is the correct behaviour, 
but makes the diff file difficult to read...

All testing is ran via 'make test' and all input files which are no included in
the zip are automatically generated by my code.
