// Dan Wortmann - testing bad strings, I feel like its rough
# There are just so many possibilites
"unterminated
"also unterminated \"
"backslach followed by space: \ is not allowed"
"bad escaped char: \a and not terminated
"another plain unterminated string
"I suppose it should also fail here #@$%$^#...
"Of course then there are \z \s \e too"
"Who can forget the \ and ' or maybe even ?"
"What else should be tested \z in this case?
"I feel like its very difficult to find errors like these''''
// Comments are ignored of course
# Even with the pound 
"After a string they are ignored too..." //comment time
"I wonder if the errors catch it right	// more comment
"I think it may treat it like part of \a \x\e the string...
"include a bad ' in a good string"
"same goes for a bad " in a good string..." but this will fail it now...
